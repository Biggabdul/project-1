  The basic idea to project 1 is the implementation of LAMP stack on an EC2 instance running on AWS platform with an ubuntu OS set up on the server.

  This was achived by following 5 basic steps:

   Step 1 — installing apache and updating the firewall


Step 2 — installing mysql


Step 3 — installing php


Step 4 — creating a virtual host for the website using apache


Step 5 — enable php on the website
